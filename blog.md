# My Journey Building the Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Introduction

Creating a web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game was an exciting project that allowed me to explore HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in more depth. In this blog post, I’ll share the steps I followed, challenges I faced, and some of the lessons I learned along the way.

## Project Overview

The goal was to create a simple, yet functional, Tic-Tac-Toe game where users can play against each other or an AI powered by the Minimax algorithm. The web app was built using:
- **HTML** for structuring the game interface
- **CSS** for styling and ensuring a user-friendly experience
- **JavaScript** for game logic and AI functionality

Here’s the [**live demo of the game**](https://sandileg.github.io/tic-tac-toe/) and the [**GitHub repository**](https://github.com/SandileG/tic-tac-toe).

## How It Works

The game allows users to:
- Play against another person or an AI
- Experience a smooth and interactive interface
- Reset and start new games as often as they'd like

The AI is built using the Minimax algorithm, which ensures that the computer always makes optimal moves.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Implementing the Minimax Algorithm

Initially, I struggled to implement the Minimax algorithm, which powers the AI. After reading up on how it works and experimenting with recursive functions, I was able to incorporate it successfully into the game.

### Challenge 2: Organizing the Codebase

I realized that some of my functions were getting too large and had multiple responsibilities, which made the code harder to maintain. Refactoring and breaking down larger functions into smaller, reusable ones made the code much cleaner and easier to manage.

### Challenge 3: Making the Game Responsive

To ensure that the game works on both desktop and mobile, I had to adjust the CSS for different screen sizes. The challenge was creating a flexible layout that adapted to small screens without losing functionality.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Commit Messages Matter**  
   Looking through my commit history, I saw the importance of clear and descriptive commit messages. They are essential for tracking progress and making collaboration smoother.
   
2. **Refactoring Is Essential**  
   Keeping functions and classes small and focused on a single responsibility made the code easier to maintain and debug.
   
3. **Stay Organized**  
   Dividing the project into smaller tasks and staying organized with tools like GitHub and Trello made the process more efficient.

## Conclusion

Building this Tic-Tac-Toe game was a rewarding experience. I learned valuable lessons in coding, debugging, and project organization. Most importantly, I developed a stronger understanding of algorithms, especially the Minimax algorithm used in AI programming.
