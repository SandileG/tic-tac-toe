## Introduction

The Tic-Tac-Toe game is designed as a classic 3x3 grid-based game where two players (or one player and an AI) take turns marking the spaces with either "X" or "O". The first player to align three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. This project showcases not only basic front-end development but also an AI opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm for strategic moves.
