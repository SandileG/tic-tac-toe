        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p>
            This project was inspired by my love for classic games and my desire to challenge myself by creating an AI that can optimally play Tic-Tac-Toe. The goal was to build something fun yet educational, where players can either compete with each other or against a computer opponent.
        </p>
        <p>
            It also serves as a Portfolio Project for ALX, showcasing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with the use of algorithms like Minimax. The project was built over a period of a few weeks, refining gameplay mechanics and user experience.
